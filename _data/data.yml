career-profile:
  title: Research Interests
  summary: |
    My research interests are centered on efficient machine learning systems, AI for science, and the underlying mathematical foundations that support these domains. 
    I have had the privilege of working alongside Professor Xinggang Wang and Professor Jun Sun since the onset of my first year at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 
    Currently, I am working with Professor Zheng Zhang, focusing on efficient pretrain for LLMs and Large Vision models.
